#' Raster-based Hourly Fine Fuel Moisture Code
#' 
#' \code{hffmcRaster} is used to calculate hourly Fine Fuel Moisture Code
#' (FFMC) based on hourly weather observations of screen level (~1.4 m)
#' temperature, relative humidity, 10 m wind speed, and 1-hour rainfall. This
#' implementation of the function includes an optional timestep input which is
#' defaulted to one hour, but can be reduced if sub-hourly calculation of the
#' code is needed.  The FFMC is in essence a bookkeeping system for moisture
#' content and thus it needs to use the last timestep's value of FFMC in its
#' calculation. \code{hffmcRaster} takes rasterized inputs and generates raster
#' maps as outputs.
#' 
#' The hourly FFMC is very similar in its structure and calculation to the
#' Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System's daily FFMC (\code{\link{fwi}})
#' but has an altered drying and wetting rate which more realistically reflects
#' the drying and wetting of a pine needle litter layer sitting on a decaying
#' organic layer.  This particular implementation of the Canadian Forest Fire
#' Danger Rating System's hourly FFMC provides for a flexible timestep; that
#' is, the data need not necessarily be in time increments of one hour.  This
#' flexibility has been added for some users who use this method with data
#' sampled more frequently that one hour.  We do not recommend using a timestep
#' much greater than one hour. An important and implicit assumption in this
#' calculation is that the input weather is constant over the timestep of each
#' calculation (e.g., typically over the previous hour).  This is a reasonable
#' assumption for an hour; however it can become problematic for longer
#' periods.  For brevity we have referred to this routine throughout this
#' description as the hourly FFMC.
#' 
#' Because of the shortened timestep, which can lead to more frequent
#' calculations and conversion between moisture content and the code value
#' itself, we have increased the precision of one of the constants in the
#' simple formula that converts litter moisture content to the 'Code' value.
#' This is necessary to avoid a potential bias that gets introduced during
#' extremely dry conditions.  This is simply a change in the precision at which
#' this constant is used in the equation and is not a change to the standard
#' FFMC conversion between moisture and code value (which is referred to as the
#' FF-scale).
#' 
#' The calculation requires the previous hour's FFMC as an input to the
#' calculation of the current hour's FFMC; this is because the routine can be
#' thought of as a bookkeeping system and needs to know the amount of moisture
#' being held in the fuel prior to any drying or wetting in the current period.
#' After each hour's calculation that newly calculated FFMC simply becomes the
#' starting FFMC in the next hour's calculation.  At the beginning of the
#' calculations at a station this previous hours FFMC must be estimated. It is
#' typical to use a value of 85 when this value cannot be estimated more
#' accurately; this code value corresponds to a moisture content of about 16\%
#' in typical pine litter fuels.
#' 
#' @param weatherstream A raster stack or brick containing hourly weather
#' observations. Variable names have to be the same as in the following list,
#' but they are case insensitive. The order in which the input variables are
#' entered is not required.

#' \var{temp} \tab (required) \tab Temperature (centigrade)\cr
#' \var{rh} \tab (required) \tab Relative humidity (\%)\cr 
#' \var{ws} \tab (required) \tab 10-m height wind speed (km/h)\cr 
#' \var{prec} \tab (required) \tab 1-hour rainfall (mm)\cr 
#' \var{bui} \tab (optional) 
#' \tab Daily BUI value for the computation of hourly FWI.\cr
#' \tab\tab It is required when \code{hourlyFWI=TRUE}.\cr }
#' @param ffmc_old A single value of FFMC or a raster of FFMC for the previous
#' hour which will be used for the current hour's calculation. In some
#' situations, there are no previous-hourly FFMC values to calculate the
#' current hourly FFMC, the function will use a default value,
#' \code{ffmc_old=84}.
#' @param time.step timestep in hours. Default is 1 hour, set for standard
#' hourly FFMC calculation. While \code{time.step} is set to values with
#' decimal places, sub-hourly FFMC would be calculated.
#' @param hourlyFWI Optional for the computation of hourly ISI, FWI, and DSR.
#' Default is FALSE. While \code{hourlyFWI=TRUE}, daily BUI is required for the
#' computation of FWI.
#' @return \code{hffmcRaster} returns a vector of hourly or sub-hourly FFMC
#' values, which may contain 1 or multiple elements. Optionally when
#' \code{hourlyFWI=TRUE}, the function also output a data.frame contains input
#' weatherstream as well as the hourly or sub-hourly FFMC, ISI, FWI, and DSR.
